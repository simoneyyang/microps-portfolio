This is not Simone propaganda &lt;3\nJokes aside, Simone is a senior pursuing a B.S. in Engineering at Harvey Mudd College, with emphasis in digital design and software. Before she was an engineer, she spent a year attempting to become a physicist (to no avail). Simone is the Senate Chair (co-President) of the Associated Students of Harvey Mudd College, and if she is not in a meeting, you will find her in the Platt basement working on the ASHMC Archive project."

    "text": "I have a lot of goals, generally, but at Mudd so far they have all been very course-based. A lot of complete-this-class and do-well-in-this-class goals. So for MicroPs this semester, my goal is to learn enough from these projects to create something for myself.\nI usually have a great time in my classes, but when I leave, that’s where it ends. I hope to take what I learn here and actually use it in my life outside of college & work.\nThe final project in this class seems like a great opportunity to do so. I want to do something challenging, but I also want to keep it when December rolls around. That’s all!"

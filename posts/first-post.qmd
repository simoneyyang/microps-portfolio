I have a lot of goals, generally, but at Mudd so far they have all been very course-based. A lot of complete-this-class and do-well-in-this-class goals. So for MicroPs this semester, my goal is to learn enough from these projects to create something for myself.

I usually have a great time in my classes, but when I leave, that's where it ends. I hope to take what I learn here and actually use it in my life outside of college & work.

The final project in this class seems like a great opportunity to do so. I want to do something challenging, but I also want to keep it when December rolls around. That's all!

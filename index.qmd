Simone Yang is a good student and role model. This is not Simone propaganda <3

Jokes aside, Simone is a senior pursuing a B.S. in Engineering at Harvey Mudd College, with emphasis in digital design and software. Before she was an engineer, she spent a year attempting to become a physicist (to no avail). Simone is the Senate Chair (co-President) of the [Associated Students of Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/ashmc), and if she is not in a meeting, you will find her in the Platt basement working on the ASHMC Archive project.
